Homework (assignments and exercises) and term project results are worth full credit at the beginning of the class on the due date. Unless granted an extension in advance, it is worth at most 75% credit for the next 48 hours, at most 50% credit after that. If you need an extension, please ask for it as soon as the need for it is known. Extensions that are requested promptly can be granted more liberally. You must turn in all assignments. <br><br>

We encourage collaboration between students and studying materials in groups when the purpose of this is to facilitate learning, not to circumvent problems. It is allowed to seek help from other students in understanding the material needed to solve a particular problem. However, students must submit individual material and solutions, unless otherwise specified. Students should declare any collaboration on the first page of homework assignments (or equivalently on exercises). If the instructors believe the collaboration is improper, your grade may be affected. Collaboration without full disclosure will be handled in compliance with CMU's Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism. If in doubt, ask!<br><br>
